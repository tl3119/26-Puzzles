# 26-Puzzles

# Description
 Implement the A* search algorithm with graph search (no repeated states) for solving the 26-puzzle problem as described below. 
 Use h(n)= Sum of Manhattan distances of the tiles from their goal positions as heuristic function. 
 The program will read in the initial and goal states from an input file and then generate an output file that contains the solution.

# Running
```
python Puzzles.py path/to/input/file.txt
```
For example, for input1 file:
```
python Puzzles.py input1.txt
```
Then, it will generate the output file contains the solution
